It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course covers the fundamentals of the baseline technologies that you need to know in order to become a full stack web developer. By the end of this course you will know how to work with: NPM, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and you will be ready to choose a front-end technology, such as Angular, for the MEAN stack, or React. Web development is evolving rapidly and developers need to know a much greater variety of technologies than they did historically. Whilst in the past you could specialize in a single area, such as client side development, modern web developers are expected to have an understanding of all areas and how they fit together. This 360-degree approach is known as full stack web developmentâ€”a bundling of core technologies on the client and server side that provides an end-to-end web development solution. Through this course, you will become familiar with the standard set of core technologies behind modern full stack development, and you will learn the skills required to become competent and comfortable in all these environments. This course assumes you know JavaScript but does not assume you know any other technology. One of the biggest issues with most videos and titles on full stack development is that they assume too many things about the student. This title is the "Critical mass," the one course that will open your eyes to the world of full stack development.
